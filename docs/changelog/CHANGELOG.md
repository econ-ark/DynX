## [0.1.8.dev4] - 2024-12-26

### Fixed
- **Solution Object Re-hydration**:
  - Fixed issue where loaded Solution objects were plain dictionaries instead of proper Solution instances
  - `load_circuit` now detects when a pickled object is a Solution dictionary and automatically converts it back to a Solution object
  - This ensures downstream code that expects Solution attributes (like `.EGM.unrefined`) works correctly
  - Regular dictionaries that don't match the Solution structure are preserved as-is
- **Branch Dictionary Handling**:
  - Fixed serialization of branch dictionaries containing Solution objects (e.g., TENU.cntn.sol with `{"from_owner": <Solution>, "from_renter": <Solution>}`)
  - Previously failed with "not pickle-able" error due to numba typed.Dict objects inside Solutions
  - Now automatically converts each Solution to dict before pickling and re-hydrates on load
  - Prevents zero-byte sol.pkl files and subsequent EOFError when loading

### Changed
- **Enhanced Config Saving**:
  - Added `_dump_yaml` helper for cleaner YAML writing
  - `_copy_configs` now supports canonical container dictionaries with `{"master", "stages", "connections"}` structure
  - Improved organization when saving stage configurations to the `stages/` subdirectory

### Technical Details
- Solution detection uses key-set check: `{"policy", "EGM", "timing"}` to identify Solution dictionaries
- Branch dictionary detection identifies dicts containing Solution objects and serializes each branch separately
- Re-hydration applies to both `sol.pkl` and `sim.pkl` files
- Uses `Solution.from_dict()` to properly reconstruct the object with all its attributes

## [0.1.8.dev3] - 2024-12-26

### Added
- **Folder-Based Config Loading**:
  - Added `load_config` helper function in `dynx.stagecraft.io` to load configurations from a structured directory
  - Expected folder structure:
    ```
    config_dir/
    ├── master.yml
    ├── stages/
    │   ├── stage1.yml
    │   └── stage2.yaml    # Both .yml and .yaml extensions supported
    └── connections.yml
    ```
  - Returns a dictionary with keys "master", "stages", and "connections"
  - Supports both `.yml` and `.yaml` file extensions for stage configurations
  - Stage names are automatically uppercased to ensure consistency with Stage object names
  
### Changed
- **Refactored `load_circuit`**:
  - Now accepts only a directory path (no more file/zip arguments)
  - Uses the new `load_config` helper internally
  - Added `restore_data` parameter (default True) to control whether solution/distribution data is restored
  - Improved error messages for missing files and directories
- **Stage Name Normalization**:
  - Stage configuration keys are now automatically uppercased when loading (e.g., `tenu.yml` → `"TENU"` key)
  - Ensures compatibility regardless of filename casing conventions

### Fixed
- **Import and Path Handling**:
  - Added missing `argparse` import for CLI functionality
  - Wrapped paths in `str()` for FileNotFoundError messages to avoid Python 3.8 compatibility issues
  - Confirmed `.yaml` extension support in `_copy_configs` (already present)
  
### Improved
- **Test Suite Updates**:
  - Updated `tests/saver/test_saver.py` to use folder-based configurations
  - Added dedicated test for `load_config` function
  - Added test for verifying folder structure after save
  - Added tests for `.yaml` file extension support

### Migration Notes
* If you were passing individual YAML files to `load_circuit`, update to pass only the directory path
* Config loading now expects the standard folder structure with `master.yml`, `connections.yml`, and `stages/` subdirectory
* The `load_config` function can be used standalone to load configurations for custom workflows
* Stage configuration files can use either `.yml` or `.yaml` extensions

## [0.1.8.dev2] - 2024-12-26

### Changed
- **Module Renaming**:
  - Renamed `config_loader` module to `makemod` for better clarity and naming consistency
  - Updated all imports throughout the codebase from `dynx.stagecraft.config_loader` to `dynx.stagecraft.makemod`
  - Updated test files to use the new module name
  - Fixed `saver.py` to properly load YAML configurations and pass them as dictionaries to `initialize_model_Circuit`
  - Updated saver.py to io.py for clarity. 

### Migration Notes
* Update all imports: Change `from dynx.stagecraft.config_loader import ...` to `from dynx.stagecraft.makemod import ...`
* The functionality remains the same - only the module name has changed
* The main function `initialize_model_Circuit` and helper functions like `compile_all_stages` retain their original names

* Dual access pattern (attribute and dictionary-style) for all solution fields
* Support for nested policy dictionaries and EGM layer storage
* Save/load functionality using NPZ + JSON format
* Comprehensive unit tests for the Solution container



### Migration Notes
* Existing code accessing `stage.dcsn.sol["policy"]` should now use `stage.dcsn.sol.policy["c"]` for consumption policy
* Housing/service policies are now accessed as `sol.policy["H"]` and `sol.policy["S"]` respectively
* EGM grids are accessed via `sol.EGM.refined.e` instead of `sol["EGM"]["refined"]["e"]`
* The Solution object can be converted to/from plain dicts using `as_dict()` and `from_dict()` methods

## [0.1.8.dev0] - 2025-05-16

* Public dev version in GitHub.

## [0.1.7.1.3.dev0] - 2025-05-16

⚠️ **Experimental Development Build**  
The **entire Dyn-X / ModCraft codebase is under active development and should be considered *experimental***.  
Breaking changes can land at any time; if you need a fixed reference point pin **a specific commit hash** or use an explicit dev pre-release such as `dynx==1.7.1.dev3`.

### Added
* **Sampler Layer Overhaul** – see prompts `prompt_v1.7.1.1-3.md`
  * `dynx.runner.sampler` now ships:
    * `BaseSampler`, `MVNormSampler`, `FullGridSampler`, `LatinHypercubeSampler`, `FixedSampler`.
    * `build_design()` helper that produces a single `dtype=object` design matrix and accompanying `info` dict.
  * New helper `_is_categorical()` to detect `enum` / `values` meta entries.
* **CircuitRunner Quality-of-Life**
  * `pack()` / `unpack()` helpers for converting between dict↔array with mixed dtypes.
  * `plot_metrics()` / `plot_errors()` convenience plots.
* **Test Suites** under `tests/runner/` & `tests/unit/runner/`
  * `test_sampler.py`, `test_build_design.py`, `test_mvn_bounds.py` for sampler layer.
  * `test_circuit_runner.py` integration smoke-tests.

### Changed
* `CircuitRunner`
  * Switched from `pickle.dumps` → `copy.deepcopy` for config cloning.
  * Improved cache-key hashing logic (handles `dtype=object`).
  * **Deprecated** `sampler` constructor arg – emits warning; will be removed in 0.1.7.
* `MVNormSampler` clips / resamples draws to honour numeric bounds when `meta` provided.
* `FullGridSampler` accepts categorical string grids.
* `LatinHypercubeSampler` now yields `dtype=float` but overall `build_design` promotes to `object` when categoricals present.
* `build_design()` signature changed: `(param_paths, samplers, Ns, meta, seed=None)` returning `(xs, info)`.
* Package exports: `dynx.runner.__init__` now re-exports all sampler classes and helpers.
* **Code Style** – Black 88-char line length enforced across modified files.

### Removed
* Legacy `enum_specs` integer mapping logic (categoricals are now inserted literally).

### Fixed
* Sampler dtype handling for mixed categorical/continuous designs.
* Assorted unit-test failures arising from interface changes.

### Migration
1. Replace any `CircuitRunner(..., sampler=<something>)` with standalone sampler calls:
   ```python
   xs, _ = build_design(param_paths, [MySampler], [N], meta)
   runner = CircuitRunner(base_cfg, param_paths, model_factory, solver)
   ```
2. Update imports:
   ```python
   from dynx.runner import MVNormSampler, build_design, CircuitRunner
   ```

## [0.1.5.09.dev0] - 2025-04-09

### Changed
- **Standardized Mover Naming Convention**:
  - Refactored `Mover`, `Stage`, `Period`, `ModelSequence`, and `CircuitBoard` to consistently use `source_name`, `target_name`, `source_keys`, and `target_key`.
  - Ensured `source_name` and `target_name` always reflect the actual data source and destination nodes for the specific mover direction (forward or backward), eliminating ambiguity.
  - Updated `ModelSequence` movers (`add_inter_period_connection`, `_create_transpose_mover`) to use global node IDs (e.g., `p0:stageA`) for `source_name` and `target_name`.
- **Removed Redundant Mover Attributes**:
  - Eliminated the setting and reliance on `mover.source_perch_attr` and `mover.target_perch_attr` in `Period` and `ModelSequence`, as this information is now correctly captured by `mover.source_keys` and `mover.target_key`.
- **Refactored Transpose Logic**:
  - Updated `ModelSequence._create_transpose_mover` to robustly derive necessary perch information by parsing the original mover's `source_keys` and `target_key`, instead of relying on the removed redundant attributes.
